Welcome to the daily tour of the Freedom Tower, the home of the Greatest Heroes the world has ever known. Our tour will begin momentarily, it is important to note that the heroes will be flying in and out as calls for help come in. We ask that you do not impede the heroes during these emergencies, otherwise most of them are willing to sign an autograph if you ask nicely. If you will all follow me this way, we will begin our tour. Now, over here on our left, we can see …

(Siren begins to sound loudly)

Everyone please remain calm, this must be an unscheduled lock-down drill. Not to worry, everyone kindly stick together and remain in a straight line. The tour will have to detour around the laser grid array and the security robots. Otherwise, on behalf of the heroes, I hope you all enjoy your Freedom Tower experience. And remember, no flash photography in the restricted areas.

## DESCRIPTION

This game is takes place in the Sentinels of the Multiverse world. While there will be several recognizable characters from the card game in this LARP, they will also be joined by everyday people without powers. Tour groups and news crews will be waiting anxiously to see if the greatest hero team ever assembled will have others join their ranks. In this time of crisis, who among you will prove to be the true heroes?

This game came from the deranged minds of `John “Izzy” Isabella` and `Nick Knapp` for the `2015 S.N.O.P.L.W. initiative`. This game has successfully run 3 times before this code was written.

# Chemical Crafting

Chemical crafting is the art of taking several `formulas` and turning them into a single `mixture`. These items can be identified by the [Formula] tag. Three different types of formulas exist in game: `Solutions`, `Compounds` and `Catalysts`. Unless a person is a trained chemist they will be unable to construct a workable mixture. People with the Crafting –Chemical ability know their way around a laboratory. A person with this ability is able to create a wide variety of mixtures by mixing together various solutions, compounds and catalysts. Each formula is unique and will add a special effect to the mixture upon completion. Crafting a mixture takes 5 minutes. By default, any mixture created has `1 use` that will last for the duration of an encounter (such as a fight or 10 minutes). Upon using a mixture, the `drinker` will take a `minimum of 4 Toxic backlash damage`.

If you have the `Crafting –Chemical` ability you are able to effectively create mixtures. `Every mixture must consist of 1 Solution and at least 1 Compound`. The `Solution` determines how the mixture can be used (direct attack, buff, damage reduction etc.) and when the mixture may be used (start of turn, power, ongoing etc.). The `Compound` determines the effect type (fire, cold, energy etc.) that the mixture will have. These effects are determined by the crafting word on the formula you used. Crafting words can be found at the bottom of the item card in (parenthesis).

You may add additional Compounds or Catalysts to your mixture until it has a total of `5 formulas`: consisting of the solution, compounds and catalysts. Additional Compounds add different effect types to the mixture. So a mixture can have both the energy and toxic tags by adding a second Compound. Catalysts add additional bonuses to your mixture that can greatly vary. This can be anything from increasing its potency (+1 to the effect) or increasing the number of targets your effect has. `Each crafting word may only be used once in a given mixture`.

Mixtures that start in game are written on item cards with the word “Mixture” on the bottom. Mixtures crafted over the course of game will be represented by plain envelopes marked with the word “Mixture”. All the formulas used to create a mixture will be placed in that envelope. If you have the Crafting –Chemical ability you may open this envelope to look at the formulas that were used to create it. `You may not remove any formula cards from a mixture envelope`. Once formulas have been mixed together they cannot be separated.

Note: A person without the `Crafting –Chemical` ability is not permitted to open a Mixture envelope to read the formula card or see what was used to create the mixture. They will have no idea what the purpose or use of the Mixture is. Even those of you with the `Crafting –Chemical` ability may not fully understand what a mixture does, until you drink it.

Mixtures that start in game (written on index cards) can be further modified. Next to the word ‘Mixture’ on the bottom of the card is the item’s `crafting number`. That number determines how complex the mixture is and how many additional formulas can be added to it. Every Mixture in game is assumed to have one solution and at least one compound.

### Modifying Mixtures that Start in Game (Crafting Number Guide):

    Crafting # = 0-3: has 2 formulas already in this mixture, you may add 3 more formulas.
    Crafting # = 4-6: has 3 formulas already in this mixture, you may add 2 more formulas.
    Crafting # = 7-9: has 4 formulas already in this mixture, you may add 1 more formulas.
    Crafting # > 10: has 5 formulas already mixed together, you may not add any more.

The crafting number is only relevant to determine how many parts can be added to `the original Mixture`. Once you create an `Enhanced Mixture` the crafting number is no longer used to determine how many formulas can be added to it. Enhanced Mixtures function the same as normal Mixtures.

## Example

You want to augment the Mixture, Sweet Elixir which has a crafting # of 6. You are only capable of adding 2 formulas to it. You add a catalyst with a crafting number of 2. The new mixture has a crafting number of 8. You may only add one more compound or catalyst to the mix.

Adding any more formulas to the mix after that point will not change the Mixture’s effect. So, if Sweet Elixir (crafting #6) has 1 catalyst and 1 compound added to it than it has the maximum number of formulas it can handle. Adding any another formulas would be a waste because the mixture cannot be altered further and the formula added would be consumed without effect.

### List of Crafting Words found on Solutions

    Active: Power – Direct (1 effect to 1 target)
    Crystalized: Power – Armor (-1 effect received for 2 turns)
    Lubricant: Power – Buff (+1 effect to 1 target for 2 turns)
    Reactant: Start - Direct (1 effect to 1 target)
    Product: End - Direct (1 effect to 1 target)
    Preserving: Ongoing – Armor (-1 effect received)
    Continuous: Ongoing – Buff (+1 effect)
    Residual: Reaction - Direct (1 effect to 1 target)
    Spasmodic: Reaction - Redirect (Redirect the next 2+potency effect to target)

### Chemistry 101 (Quick Reference Guide):

    Formulas consist of Solutions, Compounds and Catalysts.
    Each Mixture can have no more than 5 formulas in it.
    It takes about 5 minutes to create a Mixture.
    Each Mixture must have exactly 1 Solution.
    Mixtures must have at least 1 Compound (up to 4, based on number of formulas used).
    You may add between 1 & 3 Catalysts (based on the number of formulas used).
    Every Mixture can be consumed to provide an ability for an encounter.
    Each Mixture has 1 use; drinking a mixture will deal +4 Toxic backlash damage.
    Existing Mixtures can be modified based on their Crafting Number (see above).

# Mechanical Crafting

Mechanical crafting is the art of taking several `parts` and turning them into a single `device`. These items can be identified by the [Part] tag. Three different types of parts exist in game: `Frames`, `Mechanisms`, and `Components`. Unless a person is a trained mechanic they will be unable to construct a workable device. People with the Crafting –Mechanical ability know their way around a workshop. A person with this ability is able to create a wide variety of devices by putting together frames, mechanisms, and components. Each part is unique and will add a special effect to the device upon completion. Crafting a device take `5 minutes`. By default any device created has 4 uses before it can longer be used, this is due to either the device breaking or resources (such as ammo) being spent.

If you have the `Crafting –Mechanical` ability you are able to effectively create devices. `Every device must consist of 1 Frame and at least 1 Mechanism`. The `Frame` determines how the device can be used (direct attack, buff, damage reduction etc.) and when the device may be used (start of turn, power, ongoing etc.). The `Mechanism` determines the effect type (fire, cold, energy etc.) that the device will have. These effects are determined by the crafting word on the part you used. Crafting words can be found at the bottom of the item card in (parenthesis).

You may add additional Mechanisms or Components to your device until it has a total of `5 parts`: consisting of the frame, mechanisms, and components. Additional Mechanisms add different effect types to the device. So a device can have both the fire and cold tags by adding a second Mechanism. Components add additional bonuses to your device that can greatly vary. This can be anything from increasing its potency (+1 to the effect), increasing the number of targets, or adding uses to your device. `Each crafting word may only be used once in a given device`.

Devices that start in game are written on item cards with the word Device at the bottom. Once a device has been fabricated, all of the part cards used in its creation are placed inside of an envelope. The new device’s item card is placed on the outside of the envelope. If you have the Crafting –Mechanical ability you may open this envelope to see what parts were used to construct the device. The device is treated as having all of the crafting words from every parts that was used to create it. You may continue to improve your device by adding additional mechanisms and components. But when a devices has zero uses remaining the device will no longer function and all of its parts will become broken. Broken parts cannot be used in any way and their `Crafting Number is reduced to 0` (hand a C.D. any broken items).

Anyone can choose to disassemble a device. This process takes less than a minute and destroys the device. When disassembling a device, remove `ALL` the part item cards from the device envelope. Devices are built to last so the act of disassembling a device will cause some parts to become broken; 25% of the parts (round up) will gain the broken feature and be unusable in future crafting. The parts that break occur at random, however if you have the Crafting –Mechanical ability you may instead take 5 minutes when disassembling a device in order to designate 1 part that will not become broken.

Note: A person without the `Crafting –Mechanical` ability is unable to a create device at all. If a person without this ability attempts to hammer two or more parts together it will result in all the parts becoming broken. They may still use a device or attempt to disassemble a device. If they disassemble a device 50% of its parts (round up) will become broken.

Items that exist in game that say ‘Device’ on the bottom can be further modified. Next to the word ‘Device’ on the bottom of the card is the item’s `crafting number`. That number determines how complicated the Device is and how much it can be modified by adding additional parts to it. Note that you cannot take these Devices that were built pre-game apart. Every Device in game is assumed to have one frame and at least one mechanism.

### Modifying & Upgrading Devices that Start in Game (Crafting Number Guide):

    Crafting # = 0-3: has 2 parts already built into this device, you may add 3 more parts.
    Crafting # = 4-6: has 3 parts already built into this device, you may add 2 more parts.
    Crafting # = 7-9: has 4 parts already built into this device, you may add 1 more part.
    Crafting # > 10: has 5 parts already built into this device, you may not add any.

The crafting number is only relevant to determine how many parts can be added to the `original Device`. Once you create an `Upgraded Device` the crafting number is no longer used to determine how many parts can be added to it. Upgraded devices function the same as normal Devices, after the modifications are complete the Upgraded Device will have limited uses.

## Example

You want to augment the Device, Sturdy Handcuffs which has a crafting # of 6. You are only able to add 2 parts to it. You add a component with a crafting number of 2. The new device has a crafting number of 8; despite this you may only add one more mechanism or component to this device (because it is based off the original device’s crafting number, not the upgraded device). The Device cannot be modified any further unless you choose to disassemble it.

If you choose to take apart the device you can designate that the frame will not be broken. The frame is assumed to be in the original Device, the Sturdy Handcuffs. After the Device is taken apart you will have a pair of Sturdy Handcuffs (the original item) one broken part and an unbroken component. You may use the unbroken parts to create a new device, if you choose.

### List of Crafting Words found on Frames

    Cordless: Power – Direct (1 effect to 1 target)
    Welding: Power – Armor (-1 effect received for 2 turns)
    Assisting: Power – Buff (+1 effect to 1 target for 2 turns)
    Automatic: Start - Direct
    Auxiliary: End - Direct
    Sturdy: Ongoing – Armor (-1 effect received)
    Personal: Ongoing – Buff (+1 effect)
    Spring-Loaded: Reaction - Direct (1 effect to 1 target)
    Triggered: Reaction - Redirect (Redirect the next 2+potency effect to target)

### Mechanics 101 (Quick Reference Guide):

    Parts consist of Frames, Mechanisms and Components.
    Each Device can have up to 5 parts built into it.
    It takes about 5 minutes to create a Device.
    Each Device must have exactly 1 Frame.
    Devices must have at least 1 Mechanism (up to 4, based on the number of parts used).
    You may add between 1 & 3 Components (based on the number of parts used).
    Each Device has 4 uses, before it becomes broken.
    Existing Devices can be modified based on their Crafting Number (see above).
